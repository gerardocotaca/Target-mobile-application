# Final Project (Target Corporation)

This project aims to develop a Python Graphical User Interface (GUI) prototype for Target Corporation. 
The GUI will be developed using PyCharm and will serve as a platform for users to interact with the system by providing inputs or viewing 
information retrieved from external sources. The purpose of the program is to provide an updated version where users can have a faster 
shopping experience. Features include immediate access to item categories while already having selected a payment method steamlining 
the checkout process and improving operational efficiency. If a user forgot to check mark an item category they will have the option to 
select again after typing in specific items they were previously adding. Upon selection they can type in their new items in the search bar
again for a more personalized experience. The option to delete added items is available as well where users type in the item they don't want
and click delete. Once users conclude with their shopping simply clicking confirm completes all transactions as all payment information was
processed in a previous GUI page.
